##Welcome to my Pokedex project using jquery and bootstrap!

To keep things in check we've used ESLint and Prettier, 
and used a combination of JavaScript DOM Manipulation and JQuery. 

Bootstrap has been implemented with few alterations made in CSS. 
This project will be ever evovling as future enhancements are 
imagined and implemented. 

We've utilized the Pokemon API which can be found and used for free here: https://pokeapi.co/
